# ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit

Extend ArcGIS Pro with ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit. The ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit is based on the add-in and configurations extensibility pattern. This toolkit provides resources to support customizing the pages that appear in the ArcGIS Pro metadata editor to suit your organizational, community, or regional requirements. Customize the metadata display within ArcGIS Pro, and how metadata is imported to and exported from the ArcGIS Metadata XML format. Your modifications can be distributed as an ArcGIS Pro Metadata add-in.

## Introduction[](#introduction)

The ArcGIS Metadata Toolkit provides information and supports the following activities relating to the creation and management of metadata in ArcGIS Pro. Customization of the metadata experience in ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcGlobe, and ArcScene is not supported by this toolkit.

- Change the pages included in the metadata editor, except for the Item Description page, which must be included.
- Change the values provided in drop-down lists in the metadata editor.
- Change the elements included in an existing metadata page, except for metadata elements that are required by ArcGIS software.
- Add a custom metadata element to a page and to the ArcGIS metadata format.
- Add a custom page to the metadata editor.
- Change the manner in which metadata is displayed.
- Change the manner in which metadata is imported and exported to ArcGIS items, for example, to support custom metadata content. For example, export an item's ArcGIS metadata to a standard XML format, or convert a standards-compliant metadata XML document to the ArcGIS metadata XML format and store the resulting content as an item's metadata.
- Change the validation rules associated with the content that can be provided in the metadata editor.

The ArcGIS Metadata Toolkit is not intended to be used for the following purposes.

- Change the manner in which ArcGIS software communicates with the metadata editor or an itemâ€™s metadata.
- Change the entire metadata editor to store content in a different XML format instead of storing content in the ArcGIS metadata format.

## Requirements[](#requirements)
The ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit has the same requirements as the ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET. The machine on which you develop a custom version of the ArcGIS Pro metadata editor must satisfy the requirements.
* [Requirements](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki#requirements)

## Installing ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit[](#installing-arcgis-pro-metadata-toolkit)
After the ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET, and ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET (Utilities), have been downloaded and installed, the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit can also be downloaded and installed from within Visual Studio.

## Release notes[](#release-notes)

### ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit 2.4.0.19948

These release notes describe details of the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit 2.4.0.19948 release. Here you will find information about available functionality as well as known issues and limitations.

#### What's new

This release of the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit is not significantly different from the previous release.  

In the previous release, one of the XAML files that defines a page in the metadata editor had a spelling error in its name; it was named  MD_ConverageDescriptionBase.xaml. The spelling error has been corrected in the Visual Studio project, and the XAML page is now named  MD_CoverageDescriptionBase.xaml. All references to this page throughout the Visual Studio project have also been corrected so the page can function properly when used in an ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit add-in.

Additional bugs were fixed in ArcGIS Pro 2.4 that now allow custom elements contained by a "custom" element at the root of the metadata document to be successfully saved to another item's metadata. This way, you can copy customized ArcGIS metadata content from one item to another using ArcGIS Pro. This fix did not require any changes to the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit.

Also, a bug was fixed in ArcGIS Pro 2.4 that allows an installer to save a custom metadata importer XSLT and a custom metadata exporter XSLT to the core ArcGIS Pro install location, and have a custom metadata style successfully reference the translators that are available in the install location using a relative path. This fix did not require any changes to the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit.

#### Known limitations

- The ArcGIS Pro metadata toolkit can be used to customize the metadata editor and the metadata display for ArcGIS Pro 2.2. However, while ArcGIS Pro 2.2 supports importing and exporting metadata, any custom importers or exporters defined in a metadata toolkit add-in compiled for this release will not be recognized and included in the Pro 2.2 Import Metadata and Export Metadata dialog boxes. They will appear in a metadata toolkit add-in compiled for ArcGIS Pro 2.3. 
- The ArcGIS Pro metadata editor doesn't yet have a central location in which to display guidance for the content that should be provided in a metadata element.  
- The capability to validate an item's metadata using an XML schema is not yet available in ArcGIS Pro.
