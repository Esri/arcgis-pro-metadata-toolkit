# ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit

Extend ArcGIS Pro with ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit. The ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit is based on the add-in and configurations extensibility pattern. This toolkit provides resources to support customizing the pages that appear in the ArcGIS Pro metadata editor to suit your organizational, community, or regional requirements. Customize the metadata display within ArcGIS Pro, and how metadata is imported to and exported from the ArcGIS Metadata XML format. Your modifications can be distributed as an ArcGIS Pro Metadata add-in.

## Introduction[](#introduction)

The ArcGIS Metadata Toolkit provides information and supports the following activities relating to the creation and management of metadata in ArcGIS Pro. Customization of the metadata experience in ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcGlobe, and ArcScene is not supported by this toolkit.

- Change the pages included in the metadata editor, except for the Item Description page, which must be included.
- Change the values provided in drop-down lists in the metadata editor.
- Change the elements included in an existing metadata page, except for metadata elements that are required by ArcGIS software.
- Add a custom metadata element to a page and to the ArcGIS metadata format.
- Add a custom page to the metadata editor.
- Change the manner in which metadata is displayed.
- Change the manner in which metadata is imported and exported to ArcGIS items, for example, to support custom metadata content. For example, export an item's ArcGIS metadata to a standard XML format, or convert a standards-compliant metadata XML document to the ArcGIS metadata XML format and store the resulting content as an item's metadata.
- Change the validation rules associated with the content that can be provided in the metadata editor.

The ArcGIS Metadata Toolkit is not intended to be used for the following purposes.

- Change the manner in which ArcGIS software communicates with the metadata editor or an itemâ€™s metadata.
- Change the entire metadata editor to store content in a different XML format instead of storing content in the ArcGIS metadata format.

## Requirements[](#requirements)
The ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit has the same requirements as the ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET. The machine on which you develop a custom version of the ArcGIS Pro metadata editor must satisfy the requirements.
* [Requirements](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki#requirements)

## Installing ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit[](#installing-arcgis-pro-metadata-toolkit)
After the ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET, and ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET (Utilities), have been downloaded and installed, the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit can also be downloaded and installed from within Visual Studio.

## Release notes[](#release-notes)

### ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit 2.6.0.24783 

These release notes describe details of the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit 2.6.0.24783 release. Here you will find information about available functionality as well as known issues and limitations.

#### What's new

This release of the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit is not significantly different from the previous release. However, in this release, you are able to create an ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit add-in that is based on the ISO 19115-1 and ISO 19115-3 metadata standards.

Resources have been added that document the ArcGIS metadata format and its relationship to the metadata standards supported by ArcGIS Pro, including the new ISO metadata standards. Other resources show examples of how the metadata editor is configured for the metadata styles provided with ArcGIS Pro, including the validation rules that are defined for each page.

#### Known limitations

- When a custom metadata style is used, the importers and exporters defined for the custom style are not automatically selected when the Import Metadata and Export Metadata dialog boxes are opened. All of the importers and exporters provided with ArcGIS Pro are listed. If a custom importer and exporter are defined they will also be included in the list. The appropriate importer or exporter must be selected manually.
- The ArcGIS Pro metadata editor doesn't yet have a central location in which to display guidance for the content that should be provided in a metadata element.
- The capability to validate an item's metadata using an XML schema is not yet available in ArcGIS Pro.
