# ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit

Extend ArcGIS Pro with ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit. The ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit is based on the add-in and configurations extensibility pattern. This toolkit provides resources to support customizing the pages that appear in the ArcGIS Pro metadata editor to suit your organizational, community, or regional requirements. Customize the metadata display within ArcGIS Pro, and how metadata is imported to and exported from the ArcGIS Metadata XML format. Your modifications can be distributed as an ArcGIS Pro Metadata add-in.

## Introduction[](#introduction)

The ArcGIS Metadata Toolkit provides information and supports the following activities relating to the creation and management of metadata in ArcGIS Pro. Customization of the metadata experience in ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcGlobe, and ArcScene is not supported by this toolkit.

- Change the pages included in the metadata editor, except for the Item Description page, which must be included.
- Change the values provided in drop-down lists in the metadata editor.
- Change the elements included in an existing metadata page, except for metadata elements that are required by ArcGIS software.
- Add a custom metadata element to a page and to the ArcGIS metadata format.
- Add a custom page to the metadata editor.
- Change the manner in which metadata is displayed.
- Change the manner in which metadata is imported and exported to ArcGIS items, for example, to support custom metadata content. For example, export an item's ArcGIS metadata to a standard XML format, or convert a standards-compliant metadata XML document to the ArcGIS metadata XML format and store the resulting content as an item's metadata.
- Change the validation rules associated with the content that can be provided in the metadata editor.

The ArcGIS Metadata Toolkit is not intended to be used for the following purposes.

- Change the manner in which ArcGIS software communicates with the metadata editor or an item’s metadata.
- Change the entire metadata editor to store content in a different XML format instead of storing content in the ArcGIS metadata format.

## Requirements[](#requirements)
The ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit has the same requirements as the ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET. The machine on which you develop a custom version of the ArcGIS Pro metadata editor must satisfy the requirements.
* [Requirements](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-pro-sdk/wiki#requirements)

### Supported .NET framework
As indicated in the [ArcGIS Pro SDK Requirements](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-pro-sdk#requirements), ArcGIS Pro 3.4 introduces support for .NET 8.0, Microsoft's latest edition of .NET.

### Supported IDEs
As indicated in the [ArcGIS Pro SDK Requirements](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-pro-sdk#requirements),  ArcGIS Pro 3.4 SDK introduces support for Visual Studio 2022, Microsoft's latest edition of its IDE.

### Third party assemblies
_Newtonsoft Json_
At 3.4, ArcGIS Pro is using version 13.0.3.27908 of the Newtonsoft Json NuGet. It is recommended to use the same version for your ArcGIS Pro Metadata add-in.

## Installing ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit[](#installing-arcgis-pro-metadata-toolkit)
After the ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET, and ArcGIS Pro SDK for .NET (Utilities), have been downloaded and installed, the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit can also be downloaded and installed from within Visual Studio.

## Release notes[](#release-notes)

### ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit 3.4.0.55405
These release notes describe details of the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit 3.4.0.55405 release. Here you will find information about available functionality as well as known issues and limitations.

#### What’s new
In ArcGIS Pro 3.4, a change was made to support the future integration of the new metadata editor. The namespace changes that were made impact the ability to load custom metadata editor add-ins. Add-ins built using the previously available ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit will successfully extend ArcGIS Pro 3.0-3.3. This release of the ArcGIS Pro Metadata Toolkit supports ArcGIS Pro 3.4 and later versions. It will be necessary to use separate add-ins for versions 3.0-3.3.

The version of the Visual Studio template for ArcGIS Pro 3.4 is available from Visual Studio Marketplace. The Visual Studio template for ArcGIS Pro 3.0-3.3 remains available from the Visual Studio Marketplace website. For convenience, the older Visual Studio template and the source code are available as a download from this repository from the 3.3 release.

#### Bug fixes
The metadata toolkit includes bug fixes for the following items:
- A crash when expanding New Aggregate Information in the References section.
- Support deletion of geoprocessing history entries in the geoprocessing history page.

#### Leverage administrator settings
When you develop a custom metadata editor for your organization, you can work with the GIS administrator to [manage ArcGIS Pro application settings](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/application-setting-management.htm). People in the organization who use ArcGIS Pro can be required to use the custom metadata editor add-in by setting the ```MetadataStyle``` setting to the same value as the ```displayName``` property specified in your editor’s ```Config.daml``` file.

#### Known limitations
The metadata toolkit was updated to include namespace changes for the metadata editor incorporated into ArcGIS Pro 3.4.0.55405. There are no additional limitations in Pro 3.4 beyond those documented with earlier releases.
